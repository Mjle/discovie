### Synopsis
This project was made for our web application class cmps 183. 

### Installation

Students followed this [LINK](https://sites.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/luca/classes/cmps-183-hypermedia-and-the-web/cmps-183-environment-installation-instructions) provided by the instructor to set up their development environment. 
A brief rundown of what you will need is:
Python ([anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) suggested)
[Git] (https://git-scm.com/)
Terminal (MAC OS X) OR for Windows [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/index.html)
Distrbution of [web2py](http://www.web2py.com/examples/static/web2py_src.zip)

All you have to do now is clone this repository into your ~/web2py/applications/
And run in your terminal
```
python web2py/web2py.py -e
```

### Setup


### Notes
Only things that do not match up in our database are synopsis and movie posters.
Those are the things that we had to assign to each movie in order for there to be a placeholder for each movie.

One thing that we did not get time to cover in our presentation was our preferences page, where each user can rate 
movies. We were cut short and did not get to go over this part.

### Acknowledgements
