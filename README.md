### Notes
Only things that do not match up in our database are synopsis and movie posters.
Those are the things that we had to assign to each movie in order for there to be a placeholder for each movie.

One thing that we did not get time to cover in our presentation was our preferences page, where each user can rate 
movies. We were cut short and did not get to go over this part.
